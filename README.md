# blackboard-google-calandar
Blackboard assignments to google calendar. 

My school uses blackboard and it has problems with notification, so this is what I thought up using python due to not having access to blackboard api for my school. 
It uses power automate on windows to scrape the activity section, the reason for PA is because I am still looking for a way to get around robots.txt for selenium. 
After PA finishes scraping it formats text and adds to my google calendar.

although it's rough code it was one of my favorite projects that I have done 
more changes to come
